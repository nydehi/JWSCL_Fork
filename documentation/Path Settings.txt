The following overview shows which paths are necessary to use JWA and JWSCL
The Source paths are only necessary if you like to open the source files from IDE.

Note:
  This setting requires a precompiled JwaWindows.pas (i.e. JwaWindows.dcu) which is
  stored in one of the sub folders or the packages folder.

JWA
  LibraryPaths:
    <path>\jwapi\trunk\Packages\bds14\bin\release\dynamic    //e.g. uses JwaWindows.dcu 
    <path>\jwapi\trunk\COM                                   //uses JWA COM API
  Source:
    <path>\jwapi\trunk\Win32API                              //allows to Ctrl+Enter open JwaXXX.pas 
	<path>\jwapi\trunk\Win32API\jwaWindows                   //allows to Ctrl+Enter open JwaWindows.pas
	
in addition, JWSCL needs the following:

JWSCL
  LibraryPaths:
    <path>\jwscl\trunk\source                                //uses JWSCL sources
  Source:
	<path>\jwscl\trunk\source                                //allows to Ctrl+Enter open JwsclXXXX.pas
